  <h1><a href="borbonab.jpg"title ="Planta de cafe Bourbon">BOURBON</a></h1>
  <hr>
  <p>Bourbon coffee variety is a result of a natural mutation of Typica coffee , which is one of the 
    antique varieties that exist. Its one of the most relevant varieties, not because its one of the first ones to exist
    but because its a source of other varieties like Caturra and Pacas.</p>

   <p> It arouse in the isle Bourbon, east of what was Madagascar, now calle Reunion Isle. It is grown majorly in 
    Burundi,Ruanda,and Latin America. It has a sweet taste  with and fruity flavors.</p> 

  <p>It can be grown on diferent altitudes, but for optimun results its better to grow at high altitudes 
    from  1,100 to 2,000 mts above sea level.  Its fruit is <a href="bourbona.jpg" title ="Fruto de cafe Bourbon">smaller</a> 
    then a Typica and its berries mature earlier, and that is why its recomended to grow them under shade, so
    the berries mature slowly and acquire more flavors and aromas.</p> 

  <p>The fruits can be red, yellow or orange color. Yellow Bourbon that originated from Sao Paulo, 
    in Brasil, has a quite a quantity of fructose, which results with a sweet cup. On the other hand, red Bourbons
    have more glucose which generates a cup with more body.</p>   

  <p>The attributes of taste of the Bourbon makes it a high quality coffee, but it has some disadvantages
    of low resistance to pests and diseases like the fungus roya, which requires more care to be grown.
    </p>
